## 🎯 INVESTOR FAQ

**Q: Why are you better than Fetch Rewards?**  
A: We have 99.2% accuracy (vs. 87%), NFT gamification, zero-custody wallets, and patent protection. Fetch has network effects, but we have technology moat + Telegram distribution.

**Q: What if Fetch just copies your features?**  
A: They would need to license our patents or design around them (difficult). Our Telegram-first strategy gives us a different distribution channel they can't easily replicate.

**Q: Why Telegram instead of iOS/Android apps?**  
A: 900M users, no App Store gatekeeping ($0 vs. $99/year), instant monetization (Telegram Stars), crypto-native audience. We'll build native apps in Phase 2.

**Q: How do you make money?**  
A: 11 revenue streams: Telegram Stars (in-app purchases), brand partnerships ($5K-$50K/mo), POS integrations ($299-$999/mo), white-label licensing ($2M-$10M/year), transaction fees, data analytics, NFT royalties, API access, advertising, consulting.

**Q: When do patents get granted?**  
A: We filed provisionals on Nov 21, 2025. Utility patents due Nov 21, 2026. First office action ~May 2027. Grant ~Feb 2028 (30 months total). Licensing can begin with "patent pending" status.

**Q: What's your competitive moat?**  
A: 2 patents ($10.8M value), Telegram distribution (900M users), Web3 differentiation (NFTs), B2B2C model (licensing to competitors), 99.2% accuracy (12% better than Fetch).

**Q: How do you acquire users?**  
A: Year 1 (50K): Telegram influencers + referrals ($0.15 CAC). Year 2 (500K): Brand partnerships ($1.20 CAC). Year 3 (2M): POS integrations ($3.64 CAC). Average: $3.31 CAC.

**Q: What's the exit strategy?**  
A: Acquisition by Fetch ($300M-$500M), Ibotta ($400M-$600M), PayPal ($150M-$300M), or Telegram ($250M-$500M) in 3-5 years. Alternative: IPO path in 7-10 years ($1B+ valuation).

**Q: Why do you need $500K-$1M?**  
A: 40% engineering (2 devs, mobile apps), 30% marketing (influencers, referrals), 20% legal (utility patents, compliance), 10% operations (infrastructure, support). Gets us to $5.76M ARR and Series A ready.

**Q: What are the risks?**  
A: 1) Fetch copies features (mitigated by patents). 2) Crypto bear market (mitigated by USD-backed rewards). 3) Telegram bans financial apps (low probability, iOS/Android backup). 4) Patent rejection (80-86% acceptance odds, strong applications).
